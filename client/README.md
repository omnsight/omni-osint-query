# Omni Osint Query Client

This directory contains the generated [TypeScript client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/omni-osint-query-client) for the Omni Osint Query API.

## Usage

To use the client in your Node.js project, you can install it directly from GitHub. Add the following to your `package.json`:

After installation, you can use the client in your application as shown below:

```typescript
import { OpenAPI, HealthService, HealthCheck } from 'omni-osint-query/client'; // Adjust path if needed

// Configure the API client
OpenAPI.BASE = 'http://localhost:8000'; // Adjust if your server runs on a different host/port
// Configure authentication (e.g., with a bearer token)
OpenAPI.TOKEN = 'your-bearer-token';

async function main() {
  try {
    console.log('Performing health check...');
    const healthStatus: HealthCheck = await HealthService.healthCheck();
    console.log('Health Check Status:', healthStatus);
  } catch (error) {
